# Any_chord_trainer
A tiny, dependency-light Python script that fires endless random chords at you for recognition training

# üéπ Chord Recognition Trainer
A tiny, dependency-light Python script that fires endless random chords at you, waits for you to guess the notes of the chord (preferably training with a piano), and then reveals the correct answer.  
Perfect for drilling jazz chords, classical harmony, or just getting faster at reading chord symbols.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Random chord generation**  
  Major, minor, diminished, augmented, sus2/4, 6, 7, maj7, m7, m(maj7), dim7, 9, 11, 13, plus `modification`, `extention` and `omissions` options.

- **Two readability modes**  
  - *Easy mode* ‚Äì symbols are split with pipes, e.g. `Cmaj7|add9|no5`.  
  - *Pro mode* ‚Äì compact symbols, e.g. `Cmaj7add9no5`.

- **Flexible tonality system**  
  - ‚ÄúBaby mode‚Äù locks everything to **C** so you can focus on chord qualities.  
  - Full mode randomly chooses from 21 tonalities (sharps, flats, and enharmonic mixes).

- **Water reminder** *(optional)*  
  A background thread that GENTLY nags you to drink water every 20 minutes so you stay hydrated while practicing.  
  ‚ûú Disable by commenting out the two `wp.water_timer` lines.

- **Light external dependencies**  
  Uses only the Python standard library.
  ‚ûú The only additional module is `sounddevice` from `play_chord_test.py`, if play_the_chord option is false, you don't need any additional dependency
- **üéß You can play the chord to see if you are right!! üéß**
  As stated above, this functions needs additionsl package

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. Clone or download this repo.
2. Open a terminal in the project folder.
3. Run:

```bash
python chord_trainer.py
```
## ‚öí Options and Modding
Currently, *getachord* function, the main function of the code takes in 6 variables:

| Flag                 | Type | Default | Meaning                                |
| -------------------- | ---- | ------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `number_of_chords`   | int  | 1       | How many chords to generate at once    |
| `no_modification`    | bool | False   | Disable 9/11/13 modifications          |
| `no_extention`       | bool | False   | Disable add9 / add11 / add13           |
| `no_omissions`       | bool | False   | Disable `no3`, `no5`, `no7`, `no9`     |
| `easy_tonality_mode` | bool | False   | Lock tonality to C                     |
| `easy_reading_mode`  | bool | False   | Use or don't use pipe-separated symbols for clarity |
| üéßüéß`play_the_chord`  | bool | False   | * This one uses additional module called "sounddevice" from play_chord_test.py |

If the training is too hard for you with all of these options, turn some of them off with "True" to that variable
If you want to, you could also start modding and pulling this function:

```python
from chord_trainer import getachord
getachord(number_of_chords=1, no_modification=False, no_extention=False, no_omissions=False, easy_tonality_mode=False, easy_reading_mode=False, play_the_chord=False):

```
## üïπ example session:
```text
--------------------------------------------------
Welcome to the chord trainer!
--------------------------------------------------
Ready to go? (y or n): y
Chosen tonality this time: A (only influences the annotation, not the chord).
Let's play a: F#m9|add13|no5
Input anything to see the answer
you should play the following notes: ['F#', 'A', 'E', 'G#', 'D#']
--------------------------------------------------
Again? (y or n):
```
